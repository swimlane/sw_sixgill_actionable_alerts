# Sixgill Actionable Alerts

By integrating Sixgill actionable alerts, Swimlane customers gain a premium, automated threat intelligence solution based on the most comprehensive data sources from the deep, dark and surface web. It is customizable, enabling users to define key assets relevant to their brand, industry, and geolocation via Sixgill's Investigative Portal. 
Users can covertly monitor critical assets such as IP addresses, domains, vulnerabilities, and VIPs for activity on the underground and closed sources - and prioritize, as well as respond to threats directly from the Swimlane dashboard.

## Prerequisites
